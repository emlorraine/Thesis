Contemporary research primarily addresses technology aspects, while human aspects, such as empathy, privacy and ethics (EPE for short), in relation to SBEs have not yet received adequate attention. In addition to challenges with respect to technology, there are apparent tensions and conflicting requirements involving EPE. On the other hand, opportunities exist for these aspects to support one another. For example, data collected and analyzed for empathic response may be used to alert the privacy-preserving subsystem. An ethical response may turn out to be the most empathic. The main objective of this paper is to present our vision for next generation SBEs and to explore pertinent EPE factors. We propose a unified framework that incorporates a game theoretic model to address EPE interplay in SBEs. Integral to our framework, we also introduce the use of a blockchain infrastructure for the critical need to support data integrity in such data-intensive environments. We illustrate our work in progress using an example. We then present major research challenges for the realization of next generation SBEs with fused EPE.","2019-12","2021-04-21 03:55:58","2021-04-21 03:55:58","","260-267","","","","","","Next Generation Smart Built Environments","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/B49C94YN/Gračanin et al. - 2019 - Next Generation Smart Built Environments The Fusi.pdf; /Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/XDKU46GH/9014370.html","","","Ethics; Data privacy; Empathy-Ethics-Game-Theory-Privacy-Blockchain-Smart-Built-Environments; Intelligent sensors; Internet of Things; Next generation networking; Privacy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019 First IEEE International Conference on Trust, Privacy and Security in Intelligent Systems and Applications (TPS-ISA)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Artificial intelligence (AI) and its role in autonomous systems have promised everything from utopian freedom to existential dystopia. The unfilled hyperbole surrounding past and present promises regarding AI futures has left many people skeptical, afraid, or just confused. Rational discussion is often left in the wake due to the fears and fantasy evoked by the press and Hollywood. Fortunately, as a byproduct, this has resulted in a blossoming of worldwide discourse on the ethical implications of the intelligent machines we are creating. Many near and mid-term ethical concerns have arisen with the advent of autonomous systems: particularly regarding driverless cars, privacy and drones, companion- and intimate robotics, the displacement of jobs by intelligent machines, and warfighting robots among others. The IEEE Global Initiative on the Ethics of Autonomous Systems, the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the White House, and the Future of Life Institute are among many responsible organizations that are now considering the ramifications of the real-world consequences of machine autonomy as we continue to stumble about trying to find a way forward.","2016-10","2021-04-21 04:36:45","2021-04-21 04:36:45","","1779-1781","","10","104","","","Ethics and Autonomous Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: Proceedings of the IEEE","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/DBAXU7FM/Arkin - 2016 - Ethics and Autonomous Systems Perils and Promises.pdf","","","Ethics; Privacy; Artificial intelligence; Autonomous systems; Social factors; Social implications of technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet they cannot be a 100 % safe. Collisions are sometimes unavoidable. So self-driving cars need to be programmed for how they should respond to scenarios where collisions are highly likely or unavoidable. The accident-scenarios self-driving cars might face have recently been likened to the key examples and dilemmas associated with the trolley problem. In this article, we critically examine this tempting analogy. We identify three important ways in which the ethics of accidentalgorithms for self-driving cars and the philosophy of the trolley problem differ from each other. These concern: (i) the basic decision-making situation faced by those who decide how selfdriving cars should be programmed to deal with accidents; (ii) moral and legal responsibility; and (iii) decision-making in the face of risks and uncertainty. In discussing these three areas of disanalogy, we isolate and identify a number of basic issues and complexities that arise within the ethics of the programming of self-driving cars.","2016","2021-04-21 04:50:05","2021-04-21 04:50:05","2021-04-21 04:50:05","1275-1289","","5","19","","","The Ethics of Accident-Algorithms for Self-Driving Cars","","","","","","","","","","","","JSTOR","","Publisher: Springer","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/EBNKF9AP/Nyholm and Smids - 2016 - The Ethics of Accident-Algorithms for Self-Driving.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An ethical controller is proposed to be embedded into these autonomous systems, to enable their successful integration in the society and its norms. This proposed controller that integrates machine ethics is realized through three main strategies that utilize two ethical paradigms, namely deontology, and consequentialism. These strategies are triggered according to the type of event sensed and the state of the autonomous industrial cyber-physical human systems, their combination being potentially unknown or posing ethical dilemmas. Two case studies are investigated, that deal with a fire emergency, and two different contexts i.e. one with an autonomous train, and one with an autonomous industrial plant, are discussed to illustrate the controller utilization. The case studies demonstrate the potential benefits and exemplify the need to integrate ethical behaviors in autonomous industrial cyber-physical human systems already at the design phase. The proposed approach, use cases, and discussions make evident the need to address ethical aspects in new efforts to engineer industrial systems in the context of Industry 4.0.","","2021-04-26 17:53:19","2021-04-26 17:53:19","","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/FRZXFRG7/Trentesaux - Engineering ethical behaviors in autonomous indust.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Conversely, the literature on cloud computing rarely addresses human–machine interactions, which raise distinctive ethical and legal concerns. In this paper, we investigate, from a European legal and regulatory perspective, the growing interdependence and interactions of tangible and virtual elements in cloud robotics environments. We highlight specific problems and challenges in regulating such complex and dynamic ecosystems and explore potential solutions. To illustrate practical challenges, we consider several examples of cloud robotics ecosystems involving multiple parties, various physical devices, and various cloud services. These examples illuminate the complexity of interactions between relevant parties. By identifying pressing legal and regulatory issues in relation to cloud robotics, we hope to inform the policy debate and set the scene for further research.","2019-09-01","2021-04-26 17:59:29","2021-04-26 17:59:29","2021-04-26 17:59:29","77-91","","","119","","Robotics and Autonomous Systems","Cloud robotics law and regulation","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/5ZU486GS/Fosch-Villaronga and Millard - 2019 - Cloud robotics law and regulation Challenges in t.pdf","","","Law; Privacy; Cloud; Cloud computing; Cloud robotics; Cyber–physical system; Data protection; Human–robot interaction; Policy; Product safety; Robots; Technology","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The design of sociotechnical systems that involve work across multiple boundaries requires better integration of the various sub-disciplines or components of HFE, as well as increased collaboration with other disciplines that provide either expertise regarding the domain of application or expertise in concepts that can enrich the system design. In addition, ‘customers’ contribute significantly to the ‘co-production’ of products/services, as well as to their quality/safety.

Ethical aspects are among important extra-functional properties, that cover the whole life cycle with different stages from design, development, deployment/production to use of cyber physical systems. One of the ethical challenges involved is the question of identifying the responsibilities of each stakeholder associated with the development and use of a cyber-physical system. This challenge is made even more pressing by the introduction of autonomous increasingly intelligent systems that can perform functionalities without human intervention, because of the lack of experience, best practices and policies for such technology. In this article, we provide a framework for responsibility attribution based on the amount of autonomy and automation involved in AI based cyber-physical systems. Our approach enables traceability of anomalous behaviors back to the responsible agents, be they human or software, allowing us to identify and separate the ""responsibility"" of the decision-making software from human responsibility. This provides us with a framework to accommodate the ethical ""responsibility"" of the software for AI based cyber-physical systems that will be deployed in the future, underscoring the role of ethics as an important extra-functional property. Finally, this systematic approach makes apparent the need for rigorous communication protocols between different actors associated with the development and operation of cyber-physical systems that further identifies the ethical challenges involved in the form of group responsibilities.","2015-07","2021-04-26 18:03:12","2021-04-26 18:03:12","","39-44","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 0730-3157","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/EDSD2N6Y/Thekkilakattil and Dodig-Crnkovic - 2015 - Ethics Aspects of Embedded and Cyber-Physical Syst.pdf; /Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/UDHWM2Q4/7273594.html","","","Cyber-physical systems; Ethics; Artificial intelligence; Stakeholders; Ethical aspects; Extra-functional Properties; Safety; Software; Software-responsibility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE 39th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Cybersecurity is a pressing issue in the manufacturing sector. Nevertheless, managing the risk in cybersecurity has become a critical challenge for modern manufacturing enterprises. In risk management thinking, the first step is to identify the risk, then validate it, and lastly, consider responses to the risk. If the risk is below the security risk appetite of the manufacturing system, it could be accepted. However, if it is above the risk appetite, the system should appropriately respond by either avoiding, transferring, or mitigating the risk. The validation of the risk in terms of severity and likelihood of the threat, however, is challenging because the later component is hard to quantify. In this paper, Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA) method is modified by employing game theory to quantitatively assess the likelihood of cyber-physical security risks. This method utilizes the game theory approach by modeling the rivalry between the attacker and the system as a game and then try to analyze it to find the likelihood of the attacker’s action. We first define players of the game, action sets, and the utility function. Major concerns of cyber security issues in the manufacturing area are carefully considered in defining the cost function composed of defense policy, loss in production, and recovery. A linear optimization model is utilized to find a mixed-strategy Nash Equilibrium, which is the probability of choosing any action by the attacker also known as the likelihood of an attack. Numerical experiments are presented to further illustrate the method. Forecasting the attacker’s behavior enables us to assess the cybersecurity risk in a manufacturing system and thereby be more prepared with plans of proper responses.","2019-01-01","2021-04-26 18:04:03","2021-04-26 18:04:03","2021-04-26 18:04:03","605-612","","","38","","Procedia Manufacturing","Risk Assessment for Cyber Security of Manufacturing Systems","29th International Conference on Flexible Automation and Intelligent Manufacturing ( FAIM 2019), June 24-28, 2019, Limerick, Ireland, Beyond Industry 4.0: Industrial Advances, Engineering Education and Intelligent Manufacturing","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/7RTFIR4V/Zarreh et al. - 2019 - Risk Assessment for Cyber Security of Manufacturin.pdf; /Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/USMPGXZV/S2351978920300780.html","","","Cybersecurity in Manufacturing; Game Theory; Risk Assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We found that participants to six MTurk studies approved of utilitarian AVs (that sacrifice their passengers for the greater good), and would like others to buy them, but they would themselves prefer to ride in AVs that protect their passengers at all costs. They would disapprove of enforcing utilitarian AVs, and would be less willing to buy such a regulated AV. Accordingly, regulating for utilitarian algorithms may paradoxically increase casualties by postponing the adoption of a safer technology.","2016-06-24","2021-04-26 19:07:54","2021-04-26 19:07:54","2021-04-26 19:07:54","1573-1576","","6293","352","","Science","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 1510.03346 version: 1","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/BDZNTIX8/Bonnefon et al. - 2016 - The social dilemma of autonomous vehicles.pdf; /Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/BE5ZHSX7/1510.html","","","Computer Science - Computers and Society","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Resulting Cyber-Physical Systems of Systems (CPSoS) have unprecedented capabilities but also unprecedented corresponding technological complexity. This paper aims to improve understanding, awareness and methods to deal with the increasing complexity by calling for the establishment of new foundations, knowledge and methodologies. We describe causes and effects of complexity, both in general and specific to CPS, consider the evolution of complexity, and identify limitations of current methodologies and organizations for dealing with future CPS. The lack of a systematic treatment of uncertain complex environments and &ldquo;composability&rdquo;, i.e., to integrate components of a CPS without negative side effects, represent overarching limitations of existing methodologies. Dealing with future CPSoS requires: (i) increased awareness of complexity, its impact and best practices for how to deal with it, (ii) research to establish new knowledge, methods and tools for CPS engineering, and (iii) research into organizational approaches and processes to adopt new methodologies and permit efficient collaboration within and across large teams of humans supported by increasingly automated computer aided engineering systems.","2018-12","2021-04-26 19:26:33","2021-04-26 19:26:33","2021-04-26 19:26:33","40","","4","2","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 4 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/PVSN4FAG/Törngren and Grogan - 2018 - How to Deal with the Complexity of Future Cyber-Ph.pdf; /Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/5BND85XK/40.html","","","cyber-physical systems; complexity; systems engineering; uncertainty","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

They are closely related to Internet of Things (IoT) systems, except that CPS focuses on the interaction between physical, networking and computation processes. Their integration with IoT led to a new CPS aspect, the Internet of Cyber-Physical Things (IoCPT). The fast and significant evolution of CPS affects various aspects in people’s way of life and enables a wider range of services and applications including e-Health, smart homes, e-Commerce, etc. However, interconnecting the cyber and physical worlds gives rise to new dangerous security challenges. Consequently, CPS security has attracted the attention of both researchers and industries. This paper surveys the main aspects of CPS and the corresponding applications, technologies, and standards. Moreover, CPS security vulnerabilities, threats and attacks are reviewed, while the key issues and challenges are identified. Additionally, the existing security measures are presented and analyzed while identifying their main limitations.

The combination of networked digital systems and analog physical processes creates unique characteristics that change how security theory is applied. Neither cyber‐ nor physical‐security concepts alone can protect CPSs because the crossover effects can introduce unexpected vulnerabilities. Physical attacks may allow access to critical assets, resulting in damage or compromise of information being processed by the device, while cyber‐attacks may cause physical malfunctions, resulting in real‐world consequences. Therefore, security and privacy are key concerns for CPS design, development, and operation. In this chapter, we discuss how CPS security and privacy differ from that of pure cyber or physical systems and what may be done to secure these systems. Our goal is to help designers of emerging CPSs to build more secure, privacy‐enhanced products in the future.","2017","2021-05-07 19:15:42","2021-05-07 19:15:42","2021-05-07 19:15:42","1-23","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: Security and Privacy in Cyber-Physical Systems: Foundations, Principles, and Applications DOI: 10.1002/9781119226079.ch1","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/8MW2XHTX/8068872.html","","","Cyber-physical systems; Privacy; Authentication; Monitoring; NIST","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We describe causes and effects of complexity, both in general and specific to CPS, consider the evolution of complexity, and identify limitations of current methodologies and organizations for dealing with future CPS. The lack of a systematic treatment of uncertain complex environments and &ldquo;composability&rdquo;, i.e., to integrate components of a CPS without negative side effects, represent overarching limitations of existing methodologies. Dealing with future CPSoS requires: (i) increased awareness of complexity, its impact and best practices for how to deal with it, (ii) research to establish new knowledge, methods and tools for CPS engineering, and (iii) research into organizational approaches and processes to adopt new methodologies and permit efficient collaboration within and across large teams of humans supported by increasingly automated computer aided engineering systems.","2018-12","2021-05-09 01:53:05","2021-05-09 01:53:05","2021-05-09 01:53:05","40","","4","2","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 4 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/NHTWDRHK/Törngren and Grogan - 2018 - How to Deal with the Complexity of Future Cyber-Ph.pdf; /Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/58UGV4TY/htm.html","","","cyber-physical systems; complexity; systems engineering; uncertainty","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ethical aspects are among important extra-functional properties, that cover the whole life cycle with different stages from design, development, deployment/production to use of cyber physical systems. One of the ethical challenges involved is the question of identifying the responsibilities of each stakeholder associated with the development and use of a cyber-physical system. This challenge is made even more pressing by the introduction of autonomous increasingly intelligent systems that can perform functionalities without human intervention, because of the lack of experience, best practices and policies for such technology. In this article, we provide a framework for responsibility attribution based on the amount of autonomy and automation involved in AI based cyber-physical systems. Our approach enables traceability of anomalous behaviors back to the responsible agents, be they human or software, allowing us to identify and separate the ""responsibility"" of the decision-making software from human responsibility. This provides us with a framework to accommodate the ethical ""responsibility"" of the software for AI based cyber-physical systems that will be deployed in the future, underscoring the role of ethics as an important extra-functional property. Finally, this systematic approach makes apparent the need for rigorous communication protocols between different actors associated with the development and operation of cyber-physical systems that further identifies the ethical challenges involved in the form of group responsibilities.","2015-07","2021-05-09 05:21:08","2021-05-09 05:21:08","","39-44","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 0730-3157","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/BFHG9NNZ/Thekkilakattil and Dodig-Crnkovic - 2015 - Ethics Aspects of Embedded and Cyber-Physical Syst.pdf; /Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/RYHSBBWR/7273594.html","","","Cyber-physical systems; Ethics; Artificial intelligence; Stakeholders; Ethical aspects; Extra-functional Properties; Safety; Software; Software-responsibility","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 IEEE 39th Annual Computer Software and Applications Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, a system based on Cyber-Physical Social Systems, which integrates Cyber Physical System with the human factor is proposed for citizens' use. With the proposed system, citizens take role more actively in municipality processes. Thanks to the proposed system, citizens will able to report the problems they observed easily; the problems and field teams will be analyzed in the cyber system, and the task assignments are done according to the parameters such as how many time the problem reported, the report time, the distance of the field teams to the problem, the traffic jam. So, the management of task assignments can be done dynamically in optimal way.

Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are engineered systems that are built from, and depend upon the seamless integration of computational algorithms and physical components. Advances in CPS will enable capability, adaptability, scalability, resiliency, safety, security, and usability far in excess of what today’s simple embedded systems can provide. Just as the Internet revolutionized the way we interact with information, CPS technology has already begun to transform the way people interact with engineered systems. In the years ahead, smart CPS will drive innovation and competition across industry sectors, from agriculture, energy, and transportation, to architecture, healthcare, and manufacturing.

Key deterministic models that have proven successful include differential equations, synchronous digital logic and single-threaded imperative programs. Cyber-physical systems, however, combine these models in such a way that determinism is not preserved. Two projects show that deterministic CPS models with faithful physical realizations are possible and practical. The first project is PRET, which shows that the timing precision of synchronous digital logic can be practically made available at the software level of abstraction. The second project is Ptides (programming temporally-integrated distributed embedded systems), which shows that deterministic models for distributed cyber-physical systems have practical faithful realizations.

This means that production equipment and facilities have to be adapted to new products and product variants in less time. On a technical level, major challenges in factory automation are about shorter engineering phases, quicker ramp-up of production lines and connecting technical processes to business processes. Modern information and communication technologies can help to cope with these challenges. Cyber-Physical Systems - Embedded systems with decentralized control intelligence can establish communication through open networks based on internet protocols. This will lead to the replacement of classical hierarchical automation systems by self-organizing cyber physical production systems. In the near future, intelligent products themselves will become an active component within automated manufacturing systems. However, in order to let this vision come true, automation has to converge with IT. Component based automation will help to elevate the signal based point of view, which is a core concept of automation technology since decades to the level of semantic interoperability. Field bus technologies will converge with IP based network technologies opening the way for easy vertical integration. Context aware automation will automatically adapt production and logistics processes to new configuration requirements. Of course open communication and open interaction will lead to security issues that will have to be addressed on more than the technical level. While some of these technological changeovers already have begun, others are still on the level of academic research concepts. The before mentioned developments do have the potential to lead to disruptive changes in the way automation equipment is engineered and utilized. Cyber-physical production systems will drive industrial manufacturing to the digital-age and create technological as well as the organizational basis for the 4th industrial revolution.","2012-05","2021-05-09 06:00:43","2021-05-09 06:00:43","","55-55","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/D4AUV942/Schlick - 2012 - Cyber-physical systems in factory automation - Tow.pdf; /Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/R6T37BPR/authors.html","","","Artificial intelligence; Communications technology; Manufacturing automation; Production systems; Semantics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2012 9th IEEE International Workshop on Factory Communication Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because they depart from standards of logic and accuracy, they appear to be design flaws instead of examples of good evolutionary engineering. Biases are often ascribed to cognitive “constraints” or flaws in the design of the mind that were somehow not overcome by evolution. To the evolutionary psychologist, however, evolved psychological mechanisms are expected to solve particular problems well, in ways that contributed to fitness ancestrally. Viewed in this way, cognitive biasescould have evolved because they positively impacted fitness. They are, then, not necessarily designflaws—instead, they could be design features. This chapter describes research documenting adaptive biases across many domains. These include inferences about danger, the cooperativeness of others, and the sexual and romantic interests of prospective mates. This chapter also addresses the question of why biases often seem to be implemented at the cognitive level, producing genuine misperceptions, rather than merely biases in enacted behavior.","2015","2021-05-11 15:28:38","2021-05-11 15:28:38","2021-05-11 15:28:38","1-20","","","","","","","","","","","American Cancer Society","","en","Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

In this paper, we present a novel, systematic study and resulting analyses that investigate the effects of anchoring effect on human decision-making using visual analytic systems. Visual analytics interfaces typically contain multiple views that present various aspects of information such as spatial, temporal, and categorical. These views are designed to present complex, heterogeneous data in accessible forms that aid decision-making. However, human decision-making is often hindered by the use of heuristics, or cognitive biases, such as anchoring effect. Anchoring effect can be triggered by the order in which information is presented or the magnitude of information presented. Through carefully designed laboratory experiments, we present evidence of anchoring effect in analysis with visual analytics interfaces when users are primed by representation of different pieces of information. We also describe detailed analyses of users' interaction logs which reveal the impact of anchoring bias on the visual representation preferred and paths of analysis. We discuss implications for future research to possibly detect and alleviate anchoring bias.","2017-10","2021-05-11 15:30:15","2021-05-11 15:30:15","","116-126","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/3MDV2VXA/Cho et al. - 2017 - The Anchoring Effect in Decision-Making with Visua.pdf","","","Task analysis; Analytical models; Anchoring Effect; Cognitive Bias; Data visualization; Decision making; Interaction Log Analysis; Sense Making; Uncertainty; Visual analytics; Visual Analytics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

People use visual analytics tools and techniques to synthesize information and derive insight from massive, dynamic, ambiguous, and often conflicting data; detect the expected and discover the unexpected; provide timely, defensible, and understandable assessments; and communicate assessment effectively for action. The US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) chartered the National Visualization and Analytics Center™ (NVAC™) in 2004 with the goal of helping to counter future terrorist attacks in the United States and around the globe. A major objective for NVAC is to define a long-term research and development (R&D) agenda for visual analytics to address the most pressing needs in R&D to facilitate advanced analytical insight. Under the leadership of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL), the R&D agenda for visual analytics was developed to define the directions and priorities for future R&D programs focused on visual analytics tools. This agenda, Illuminating the Path, provides a coordinated technical vision for government and industrial investments and helps ensure that a continual stream of technology and tools enter the hands of analysts and emergency responders.","2005-01-01","2021-05-11 15:30:52","2021-05-11 15:30:52","2021-05-11 15:30:52","","","","","","","Illuminating the Path","","","","","United States.

In this paper, we establish a conceptual framework for considering bias assessment through human-in-the-loop systems and lay the theoretical foundations for bias measurement. We propose six preliminary metrics to systematically detect and quantify bias from user interactions and demonstrate how the metrics might be implemented in an existing visual analytic system, InterAxis. We discuss how our proposed metrics could be used by visual analytic systems to mitigate the negative effects of cognitive biases by making users aware of biased processes throughout their analyses.","2017-10","2021-05-11 15:31:35","2021-05-11 15:31:35","2021-05-11 15:31:35","104-115","","","","","","Warning, Bias May Occur","","","","","IEEE","Phoenix, AZ","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/EZ5KW74Q/Wall et al. - 2017 - Warning, Bias May Occur A Proposed Approach to De.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2017 IEEE Conference on Visual Analytics Science and Technology (VAST)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Visual analytics tools increasingly play a key role in exploring and answering complex questions about these large datasets. However, many visualizations are not designed to concurrently visualize the large number of dimensions present in complex datasets (e.g. tens of thousands of distinct codes in an electronic health record system). This fact, combined with the ability of many visual analytics systems to enable rapid, ad-hoc specification of groups, or cohorts, of individuals based on a small subset of visualized dimensions, leads to the possibility of introducing selection bias-when the user creates a cohort based on a specified set of dimensions, differences across many other unseen dimensions may also be introduced. These unintended side effects may result in the cohort no longer being representative of the larger population intended to be studied, which can negatively affect the validity of subsequent analyses. We present techniques for selection bias tracking and visualization that can be incorporated into high-dimensional exploratory visual analytics systems, with a focus on medical data with existing data hierarchies. These techniques include: (1) tree-based cohort provenance and visualization, including a user-specified baseline cohort that all other cohorts are compared against, and visual encoding of cohort “drift”, which indicates where selection bias may have occurred, and (2) a set of visualizations, including a novel icicle-plot based visualization, to compare in detail the per-dimension differences between the baseline and a user-specified focus cohort. These techniques are integrated into a medical temporal event sequence visual analytics tool. We present example use cases and report findings from domain expert user interviews.","2020-01","2021-05-11 15:32:14","2021-05-11 15:32:14","","429-439","","1","26","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/MMWSTRM8/Borland et al. - 2020 - Selection Bias Tracking and Detailed Subset Compar.pdf; /Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/V95PDFII/8807213.html","","","Tools; Data visualization; Visual analytics; cohort selection; Complexity theory; Encoding; High-dimensional visualization; Medical diagnostic imaging; medical informatics; selection bias; visual analytics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Bias mitigation strategies often focus on the person, by educating people about their biases, typically with little success. We focus instead on the system, presenting the first evidence that altering the design of an interactive visualization tool can mitigate a strong bias - the attraction effect. Participants viewed 2D scatterplots where choices between superior alternatives were affected by the placement of other suboptimal points. We found that highlighting the superior alternatives weakened the bias, but did not eliminate it. We then tested an interactive approach where participants completely removed locally dominated points from the view, inspired by the elimination by aspects strategy in the decision-making literature. This approach strongly decreased the bias, leading to a counterintuitive suggestion: tools that allow removing inappropriately salient or distracting data from a view may help lead users to make more rational decisions.","2019-01","2021-05-11 15:32:48","2021-05-11 15:32:48","","850-860","","1","25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/ATAXCW96/Dimara et al. - 2019 - Mitigating the Attraction Effect with Visualizatio.pdf; /Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/793FLU97/8440809.html","","","Task analysis; Data visualization; Decision making; attraction effect; bias alleviation; bias mitigation; Cognition; cognitive bias; debiasing; information visualization; Training; Visualization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An anchoring and adjustment process?","Appetite","","1095-8304","10.1016/j.appet.2014.06.018","","People consistently over-eat when served a large compared with a small (appropriate) portion of food. However, the mechanism underlying this so-called portion size effect is not well understood. We argue that the process of anchoring and adjustment naturally describes this effect, such that the size of a presented portion works as an anchor that strongly influences consumption. The classical anchoring and adjustment paradigm was applied to six hypothetical eating situations. Participants were asked to imagine being served either a small or a large portion of food (i.e., low and high anchor) and to indicate whether they would consume more or less than this amount. Then, they indicated how much they would eat. These estimates were compared with a no-anchor condition where participants did not imagine a specific portion size but only indicated how much they would eat. In addition, half of participants in the anchoring conditions received a discounting instruction stating that the portion size they had been asked to imagine was randomly selected and thus not informative for their consumption estimate. As expected, participants who imagined to be served larger portions estimated to consume significantly more food than participants in the no-anchor condition, and participants who imagined to be served smaller portions estimated to consume significantly less food than participants in the no-anchor condition. The discounting manipulation did not reduce this effect of the anchors. We suggest that the process of anchoring and adjustment may provide a useful framework to understand the portion size effect and we discuss implications of this perspective.","2014-10","2021-05-11 15:35:09","2021-05-11 15:35:09","","108-115","","","81","","Appetite","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","PubMed","","PMID: 24949567","","","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24949567","","Adolescent; Adult; Anchoring and adjustment heuristic; Cognitive bias; Decision-making process; Diet; Eating behavior; Energy Intake; Feeding Behavior; Female; Humans; Intervention strategies; Male; Meals; Pilot Projects; Portion Size; Portion size effect; Random Allocation; Young Adult","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using criminal trial judges as participants, Study 1 demonstrates that such a direct influence does, in fact, exist, Sentencing decisions are assimilated to the sentence demanded by the prosecutor.

Study 2 revealed a contrast effect when the activated information was not representative for the absolute judgment and the targets of the 2 judgment tasks were sufficiently different.

There is limited empirical research documenting how these biases affect visual data analysis activities. Existing taxonomies are organized by cognitive theories that are hard to associate with visualization tasks. Based on a survey of the literature we propose a task-based taxonomy of 154 cognitive biases organized in 7 main categories.

The goal of them is to uncover how well the human user performs graph-specific tasks, in many cases compared to previously designed graph visualizations. Due to the fact that many parameters in a graph dataset as well as the visual representation of them might be varied and many user studies have been conducted in this space, a state-of-the-art survey is needed to understand evaluation results and findings to inform the future design, research, and application of graph visualizations. In this article, we classify the present literature on the topmost level into graph interpretation, graph memorability, and graph creation where the users with their tasks stand in focus of the evaluation, not the computational aspects.

"VYKE4JHE","journalArticle","2021","","Viral Visualizations: How Coronavirus Skeptics Use Orthodox Data Practices to Promote Unorthodox Science Online","","","","","","Controversial understandings of the coronavirus pandemic have turned data visualizations into a battleground. Defying public health officials, coronavirus skeptics on US social media spent much of 2020 creating data visualizations showing that the government’s pandemic response was excessive and that the crisis was over. This paper investigates how pandemic visualizations circulated on social media, and shows that people who mistrust the scientific establishment often deploy the same rhetorics of data-driven decisionmaking used by experts, but to advocate for radical policy changes. Using a quantitative analysis of how visualizations spread on Twitter and an ethnographic approach to analyzing conversations about COVID data on Facebook, we document an epistemological gap that leads pro- and anti-mask groups to draw drastically different inferences from similar data. Ultimately, we argue that the deployment of COVID data visualizations reflect a deeper sociopolitical rift regarding the place of science in public life.","2021","2021-09-10 16:59:26","2021-09-10 16:59:26","","18","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/8247KZYV/2021 - Viral Visualizations How Coronavirus Skeptics Use.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Storytellers, especially online journalists, have increasingly been integrating visualizations into their narratives, in some cases allowing the visualization to function in place of a written story. In this paper, we systematically review the design space of this emerging class of visualizations. Drawing on case studies from news media to visualization research, we identify distinct genres of narrative visualization. We characterize these design differences, together with interactivity and messaging, in terms of the balance between the narrative ﬂow intended by the author (imposed by graphical elements and the interface) and story discovery on the part of the reader (often through interactive exploration). Our framework suggests design strategies for narrative visualization, including promising under-explored approaches to journalistic storytelling and educational media.","2010-11","2021-09-10 16:59:36","2021-09-10 16:59:37","2021-09-10 16:59:36","1139-1148","","6","16","","IEEE Trans.

However, evaluating the impact of an uncertainty visualization is complex due to the difficulties that people have interpreting uncertainty and the challenge of defining correct behavior with uncertainty information. Currently, evaluators of uncertainty visualization must rely on general purpose visualization evaluation frameworks which can be ill-equipped to provide guidance with the unique difficulties of assessing judgments under uncertainty. To help evaluators navigate these complexities, we present a taxonomy for characterizing decisions made in designing an evaluation of an uncertainty visualization. Our taxonomy differentiates six levels of decisions that comprise an uncertainty visualization evaluation: the behavioral targets of the study, expected effects from an uncertainty visualization, evaluation goals, measures, elicitation techniques, and analysis approaches. Applying our taxonomy to 86 user studies of uncertainty visualizations, we find that existing evaluation practice, particularly in visualization research, focuses on Performance and Satisfaction-based measures that assume more predictable and statistically-driven judgment behavior than is suggested by research on human judgment and decision making. We reflect on common themes in evaluation practice concerning the interpretation and semantics of uncertainty, the use of confidence reporting, and a bias toward evaluating performance as accuracy rather than decision quality. We conclude with a concrete set of recommendations for evaluators designed to reduce the mismatch between the conceptualization of uncertainty in visualization versus other fields.","2019-01","2021-09-10 17:00:10","2021-09-10 17:00:10","","903-913","","1","25","","","In Pursuit of Error","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/3AK8HG3Q/Hullman et al. - 2019 - In Pursuit of Error A Survey of Uncertainty Visua.pdf","","","Task analysis; Data visualization; Decision making; Uncertainty; Visualization; Taxonomy; Measurement uncertainty; probability distribution; subjective confidence; Uncertainty visualization; user study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

I contribute a detailed characterization of practices, associations, and attitudes related to uncertainty communication among visualization authors, derived from the results of surveying 90 authors who regularly create visualizations for others as part of their work, and interviewing thirteen influential visualization designers. My results highlight challenges that authors face and expose assumptions and inconsistencies in beliefs about the role of uncertainty in visualization. In particular, a clear contradiction arises between authors' acknowledgment of the value of depicting uncertainty and the norm of omitting direct depiction of uncertainty. To help explain this contradiction, I present a rhetorical model of uncertainty omission in visualization-based communication. I also adapt a formal statistical model of how viewers judge the strength of a signal in a visualization to visualization-based communication, to argue that uncertainty communication necessarily reduces degrees of freedom in viewers' statistical inferences. I conclude with recommendations for how visualization research on uncertainty communication could better serve practitioners' current needs and values while deepening understanding of assumptions that reinforce uncertainty omission.","2019-08-05","2021-09-10 17:00:23","2021-09-10 17:00:23","2021-09-10 17:00:23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 1908.01697","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/VPYML62Z/Hullman - 2019 - Why Authors Don't Visualize Uncertainty.pdf; /Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/5ZE9NLAH/1908.html","","","Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For each of the levels of cognitive processing, we discuss examples of biases from the cognitive science literature and speculate how they might also be important to the area of visualization. In addition, we put forward a methodological discussion on how biases might be studied on all three levels, and which pitfalls and threats to validity exist.

Unfortunately, these taxonomies fail when applied to communicative visualizations. Instead, designers often resort to evaluating communicative visualizations from the cognitive efficiency perspective: ""can the recipient accurately decode my message/insight?"" However, designers are unlikely to be satisfied if the message went 'in one ear and out the other.' The consequence of this inconsistency is that it is difficult to design or select between competing options in a principled way. The problem we address is the fundamental mismatch between how designers want to describe their intent, and the language they have. We argue that visualization designers can address this limitation through a learning lens: that the recipient is a student and the designer a teacher. By using learning objectives, designers can better define, assess, and compare communicative visualizations. We illustrate how the learning-based approach provides a framework for understanding a wide array of communicative goals. To understand how the framework can be applied (and its limitations), we surveyed and interviewed members of the Data Visualization Society using their own visualizations as a probe. Through this study we identified the broad range of objectives in communicative visualizations and the prevalence of certain objective types.","2020-09-15","2021-09-10 17:01:08","2021-09-10 17:01:08","2021-09-10 17:01:08","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 2009.07095","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/EZ6FNYC2/Adar and Lee - 2020 - Communicative Visualizations as a Learning Problem.pdf; /Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/X3Z3CDMY/2009.html","","","Computer Science - Human-Computer Interaction","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a lack of automatic visualization assessment approaches, which hinders further applications like visualization recommendation, indexing, and generation. In this paper, we propose automating the visualization assessment process with modern machine learning approaches. We utilize a semi-supervised learning method, which first employs Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to learn effective features from visualizations, subsequently training machine learning models for different assessment tasks. Then, we can automatically assess new visualization images by predicting their scores or rankings with the trained model. To evaluate our method, we run two different assessment tasks, namely, aesthetics and memorability, on different visualization datasets. Experiments show that our method can learn effective visual features and achieves good performance on these assessment tasks.","2019-10","2021-09-10 17:03:28","2021-09-10 17:03:28","","126-130","","","","","","Visualization Assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/RK5F6HER/Fu et al. - 2019 - Visualization Assessment A Machine Learning Appro.pdf; /Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/FLQPPBRK/8933570.html","","","Task analysis; Data visualization; Training; Visualization; automated design; Feature extraction; Machine learning; Predictive models; presentation; visualization assessment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2019 IEEE Visualization Conference (VIS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most scholarship on the relationship between user, interface, and designer focuses on how agency is shared between designer and user within the visualization interface. This paper focuses on an additional site in which user agency may occur: during visualization development. A user-centered development process involving audience engagement and co-creation can provide an additional space in which to negotiate agency. This paper envisions how this process might work, focusing on one example of user collaboration in the development of an interactive visualization for communicating about risks associated with sea-level rise. It outlines decisions made by developers regarding interface design, data selection, and risk scenario parameters, illustrates pathways by which users have participated in the design process, and describes how user feedback has helped shape the ultimate interaction space.

Research questions: 1. Are people deceived by common deceptive tactics or exaggerated titles used in data visualizations about non-controversial topics? 2. Does a person's previous data visualization coursework mitigate the extent to which they are deceived by deceptive tactics used in data visualizations? 3. What parts of data visualizations (title, shape, data labels) do people use to answer questions about the information being presented in data visualizations? Literature review: Although scholarship from psychology, human-computer interaction, and computer science has examined how data visualizations are processed by readers, scholars have not adequately researched how susceptible people are to a range of deceptive tactics used in data visualizations, especially when paired with textual content. Methodology: Participants (n = 329) were randomly assigned to view one of four treatments for four different graph types (bar, line, pie, and bubble) and then asked to answer a question about each graph. Participants were asked to rank the ease with which they read each graph and comment on what they used to respond to the question about each graph. Results/Discussion: Results show that deceptive tactics caused participants to misinterpret information in the deceptive versus control visualizations across all graph types. Neither graph titles nor previous coursework impacted responses for any of the graphs. Qualitative responses illuminate people's perceptions of graph readability and what information they use to read different types of graphs. Conclusions: Recommendations are made to improve data visualization instruction, including critically examining software defaults and the ease with which people give agency over to software when preparing data visualizations.

In this work, we study whether such effects continue to exist when titles and visualizations exhibit greater degrees of misalignment: titles whose message differs from the visually cued message in the visualization, and titles whose message contradicts the visualization. We found that although titles with a contradictory slant triggered more people to identify bias compared to titles with a miscued slant, visualizations were persistently perceived as impartial by the majority. Further, people’s recall of the visualization’s message more frequently aligned with the titles than the visualization. Based on these results, we discuss the potential of leveraging textual components to detect and combat visual-based misinformation with text-based slants.","2019-05-02","2021-09-10 17:15:43","2021-09-10 17:15:43","2021-09-10 17:15:43","1-13","","","","","","","","","","","ACM","Glasgow Scotland Uk","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/KQJ8CPJW/Kong et al. - 2019 - Trust and Recall of Information across Varying Deg.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","CHI '19: CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Unfortunately, most of these DL models are considered as black-boxes with low interpretability. In this research, we propose an original PHM framework based on visual data analysis. The most suitable space dimension for the data visualization is the 2D-space, which necessarily involves a signiﬁcant reduction from a highdimensional to a low-dimensional data space. To perform the data analysis and the diagnostic interpretation in a PHM framework, a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) is used jointly with a classiﬁer.

Through a literature review, we point out that the existing definitions of effectiveness are incomplete and often inconsistent – a problem that has deeply affected the design and evaluation of visualization. There is also a lack of standards for measuring the effectiveness of visualization as well as a lack of standardized procedures. We have identified a set of basic research issues that must be addressed. Finally, we provide a more comprehensive definition of effective visualization and discuss a set of quantitative and qualitative measures.

Previous work has examined the relationship between complexity and various aspects of presentation, including font styles, colours and images, but automatically quantifying this dimension of a web page at the level of the document remains a challenge. In this paper we demonstrate that areas of high complexity can be identified by detecting areas, or ‘chunks’, of a web page high in block-level elements. We report a computational algorithm that captures this metric and places web pages in a sequence that shows an 86% correlation with the sequences generated through user judgements of complexity. The work shows that structural aspects of a web page influence how complex a user perceives it to be, and presents a straightforward means of determining complexity through examining the DOM.","2013-05-01","2021-10-05 15:37:48","2021-10-05 15:37:48","2021-10-05 15:37:48","491-502","","5","32","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Taylor & Francis _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/0144929X.2012.726647","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/AVPS2T7A/Harper et al. - 2013 - Analysing the visual complexity of web pages using.pdf","","","block-level HTML; perceived visual complexity; pragmatic computational technique; visual perception; World Wide Web","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This should not surprise visual perception researchers because excess and/or disorganized display items can cause crowding, masking, decreased recognition performance due to occlusion, greater difficulty at both segmenting a scene and performing visual search, and so on. Given a reliable measure of the visual clutter in a display, designers could optimize display clutter. Furthermore, a measure of visual clutter could help generalize models like Guided Search (J. M. Wolfe, 1994) by providing a substitute for “set size” more easily computable on more complex and natural imagery. In this article, we present and test several measures of visual clutter, which operate on arbitrary images as input. The first is a new version of the Feature Congestion measure of visual clutter presented in R. Rosenholtz, Y. Li, S. Mansfield, and Z. Jin (2005). This Feature Congestion measure of visual clutter is based on the analogy that the more cluttered a display or scene is, the more difficult it would be to add a new item that would reliably draw attention. A second measure of visual clutter, Subband Entropy, is based on the notion that clutter is related to the visual information in the display. Finally, we test a third measure, Edge Density, used by M. L. Mack and A. Oliva (2004) as a measure of subjective visual complexity. We explore the use of these measures as stand-ins for set size in visual search models and demonstrate that they correlate well with search performance in complex imagery. This includes the search-in-clutter displays of J. M. Wolfe, A. Oliva, T. S. Horowitz, S. Butcher, and A. Bompas (2002) and Bravo and Farid (2004), as well as new search experiments. An additional experiment suggests that color variability, accounted for by Feature Congestion but not the Edge Density measure or the Subband Entropy measure, does matter for visual clutter.","2007-08-16","2021-10-05 16:19:55","2021-10-05 16:19:55","2021-10-05 16:19:55","17","","2","7","","Journal of Vision","","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/Q9PJA4H9/article.html; /Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/39FGF972/Rosenholtz et al. - 2007 - Measuring visual clutter.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The experiments involved 800 images, each previously rated by thirty participants on perceived complexity. In a first set of experiments we analysed the correlation of individual features with the average human response, obtaining correlations up to rs=.771. In a second set of experiments we employed Machine Learning techniques to predict the average visual complexity score attributed by humans to each stimuli. The best configurations obtained a correlation of rs=.832. The average prediction error of the Machine Learning system over the set of all stimuli was .096 in a normalized 0 to 1 interval, showing that it is possible to predict, with high accuracy human responses.

By introducing the social preference theory, the target of this paper is to reveal the micro-interaction mechanism of public opinion polarization. Firstly, we divide the social preferences of Internet users (network nodes) into three categories: egoistic, altruistic, and fair preferences, and adopt the revenue function to define the benefits obtained by individuals with different preferences among their interaction process so as to analyze their decision-making behaviors driven by the revenue. Secondly, the revenue function is used to judge the exit rules of nodes in a network, and then a dynamic network of spreading public opinion with the node (individual) exit mechanism is built based on a BA scale-free network. Subsequently, the influences of different social preferences, as well as individual revenue on the effect of public opinion polarization, are analyzed through simulation experiments. The simulation results show that (1) Different social preferences demonstrate different influences on the evolution of public opinions, (2) Individuals tend to interact with ones with different preferences, (3) The network with a single preference or a high aggregation is more likely to form public opinion polarization. Finally, the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed model are verified by a real case.","2020-01","2021-10-07 16:13:57","2021-10-07 16:13:57","2021-10-07 16:13:57","946","","3","17","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 3 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/JFAV6HBV/946.html; /Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/5PEDQCF8/Chen et al. - 2020 - Public Opinion Polarization by Individual Revenue .pdf","","","individual interaction; individual revenue; public opinion polarization; social preference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We replace the English text symbol sequence originally used to illustrate the theory by a discrete, bandlimited signal. Using Shannon's later theory of sampling we derive a new and symmetric version of the second order entropy in 1D. The new theory then naturally extends to 2D and higher dimensions, where by naturally we mean simple, symmetric, isotropic and parsimonious. Simplicity arises from the direct application of Shannon's joint entropy equalities and inequalities to the gradient (del) vector field image embodying the second order relations of the scalar image. Parsimony is guaranteed by halving of the vector data rate using Papoulis' generalized sampling expansion. The new 2D entropy measure, which we dub delentropy, is underpinned by a computable probability density function we call deldensity. The deldensity captures the underlying spatial image structure and pixel co-occurrence. It achieves this because each scalar image pixel value is nonlocally related to the entire gradient vector field. Both deldensity and delentropy are highly tractable and yield many interesting connections and useful inequalities. The new measure explicitly defines a realizable encoding algorithm and a corresponding reconstruction. Initial tests show that delentropy compares favourably with the conventional intensity-based histogram entropy and the compressed data rates of lossless image encoders (GIF, PNG, WEBP, JP2K-LS and JPG-LS) for a selection of images. The symmetric approach may have applications to higher dimensions and problems concerning image complexity measures.","2016-09-05","2021-10-21 18:41:00","2021-10-21 18:41:00","2021-10-21 18:41:00","","","","","","","Reflections on Shannon Information","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 1609.01117","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/7SK569B3/Larkin - 2016 - Reflections on Shannon Information In search of a.pdf; /Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/NGA8VWAX/1609.html","","","Computer Science - Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; Computer Science - Information Theory; I.4.1; I.4.10; I.4.2; I.4.5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It turns out that (1) all linear inequalities that are valid for Kolmogorov complexity are also valid for Shannon entropy and vice versa; (2) all linear inequalities that are valid for Shannon entropy are valid for ranks of finite subsets of linear spaces; (3) the opposite statement is not true; Ingleton's inequality (1971, “Combinatorial Mathematics and Its Applications,” pp. 149–167.

In addition, two different multi-label solution approaches are compared: label powerset (LP) and binary relevance (BR) methods. The experimental studies show that the proposed LP-CNN model achieves 93.75% accuracy, while the BR-CNN model reaches 92.97% accuracy on the test set, which contains real-world line chart images.

We identify Trump vs Clinton supporters and reconstruct their political interaction network. We observe a preference for cross-cutting political interactions between the two communities rather than within-group interactions, thus contradicting the echo chamber narrative. Furthermore, these interactions are asymmetrical: Clinton supporters are particularly eager to answer comments by Trump supporters. Beside asymmetric heterophily, users show assortative behavior for activity, and disassortative, asymmetric behavior for popularity. Our findings are tested against a null model of random interactions, by using two different approaches: a network rewiring which preserves the activity of nodes, and a logit regression which takes into account possible confounding factors. Finally, we explore possible socio-demographic implications. Users show a tendency for geographical homophily and a small positive correlation between cross-interactions and voter abstention. Our findings shed light on public opinion formation on social media, calling for a better understanding of the social dynamics at play in this context.","2021-02-02","2021-12-07 17:05:09","2021-12-07 17:05:09","2021-12-07 17:05:09","2818","","1","11","","Sci Rep","","","","","","","","en","2021 The Author(s)","","","","www.nature.com","","Bandiera_abtest: a Cc_license_type: cc_by Cg_type: Nature Research Journals Number: 1 Primary_atype: Research Publisher: Nature Publishing Group Subject_term: Complex networks;Computer science;Human behaviour Subject_term_id: complex-networks;computer-science;human-behaviour","","/Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/34EJIIQE/De Francisci Morales et al. - 2021 - No echo in the chambers of political interactions .pdf; /Users/emmabaker/Zotero/storage/85KWPKPH/s41598-021-81531-x.html","","","Complex networks; Computer science; Human behaviour","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
