Commercialized software systems have made it so that anyone with a baseline level of computer literacy has access to tools for their own visualization needs. This expansion of visualization creation is one part of a growing capacity of information sharing in online spaces. In the field of visual analytics, there is not an easy narrative to capture how visualizations as a technique of information sharing transformed from highly-specialized use cases to an arena where information is endlessly accessible. Further, there is a dearth of explicit study in how these highly-social and often fluid online spaces shape how users engage and learn from data visualization systems. This thesis outlines the extent to which data visualization systems infiltrate online social communities and characterizes the conditions under which users engage or do not engage with data visualizations.
